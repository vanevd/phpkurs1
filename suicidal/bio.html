Suicidal Tendencies (also known as S.T. or simply Suicidal) are an American crossover thrash band founded in 1980 in Venice, California by vocalist Mike Muir, who is the only remaining original member of the band. Their current lineup includes Muir, guitarists Dean Pleasants and Jeff Pogan, bassist Ra Díaz and drummer Dave Lombardo. Along with D.R.I. and S.O.D., they are often credited as one of "the fathers of crossover thrash". To date, Suicidal Tendencies have released twelve studio albums (three of them are composed of re-recorded or previously unreleased material), one EP, four split albums, four compilation albums, and two long-form videos.

Suicidal Tendencies achieved their first success with their 1983 self-titled debut album; it spawned the single "Institutionalized", which was one of the first hardcore punk videos to receive substantial airplay on MTV. After releasing one new song on the split release Welcome to Venice (1985) and their second studio album Join the Army (1987), Suicidal Tendencies were signed to Epic Records in 1988, and continued their commercial success with its next three albums, How Will I Laugh Tomorrow When I Can't Even Smile Today (1988), Controlled by Hatred/Feel Like Shit...Déjà Vu (1989) and Lights...Camera...Revolution! (1990); the latter of the two were certified Gold by the RIAA. Their 1992 follow-up album The Art of Rebellion was also very successful, and included three of their biggest hits "Asleep at the Wheel", "Nobody Hears" and "I' Hate You Better".

After releasing two more studio albums (Still Cyco After All These Years and Suicidal for Life), the band broke up and severed ties from Sony and Epic in 1995. However, they reunited a year later and have continued to perform and record since then. After over a decade of work and many lineup changes, Suicidal Tendencies released their eleventh studio album with all-new material, 13, in 2013, followed three years later by World Gone Mad (2016); both albums were well-received by critics, and considered comebacks for Suicidal Tendencies.
